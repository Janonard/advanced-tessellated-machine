# advanced tessellated machine

Welcome to the world of the advanced tesselated machine!

ATM is a computer architecture focused on having fun writing assembler programs.
It features four 16-bit processors with 64k of Memory each, text output and keyboard access,
a bit like the old computers did!

But while the interesting aspects of these old systems are
included, the annoying and boring aren't! After a bit of learning, almost every command is
self-explaining and you can produce clean, nice-to-read assembly code.

This doesn't say that programming for ATM is easy, of course it isn't! The cost of having
full controll over everything is that you have to do almost everything on you own: No standart
libraries, no classes, no functions, not even loops! This makes ATM easy to learn, but hard to
master, an old video game design philosophy used since the 1970s.

Still interested? Well then, just start with it by reading the [docs](share/doc/atm/md/README.md)!

This piece of software is neither completed nor actively maintained and developed. If you feel
interested in the project, you can still fork the project and restart the development, but I currently
feel that this project isn't worth my time.

## Installation

Currently, there are packages available which means that you have to compile the source code on
your own. But don't worry, it is easier than it sounds. Simply follow [this guide.](share/doc/atm/md/Installation.md)
